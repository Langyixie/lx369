<p> Attention is one of my favorite song, I find a 3D version online to compare with the original version. It's not recoreded by 3D microphone, but sounds like 3D by mixing.</P>

<p> I put the 3D audio mixing version together with the original version to compare the difference between them.</p>
<p> The 3D audio version has richer sound which makes the music virtically, and the original version just sounds plat.</p>
